Implementation of data structures and algorithms in Python for study and practice

I created this repository to aid in my study of data structures and algorithms. I will be coding my own implementations of content found on the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. Secondary goals are to explore some features of Object Oriented Programming and leverage reusable code, get into the habit of developing tests and, finally, to get comfortable with git and its features.
